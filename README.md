# protoc-gen-gogoroach
protoc (protobuf compiler) plugin for CockroachDB protobuf files.

This `protoc` plugin is used to generate Go protobuf struct
definitions compatible with CockroachDB.

Differences with the base `protoc-gen-gogo` plugin:

- Go getters not generated by default, since they are usually not
  needed and pollute the public API of a package.
- Generation of the additional `MarshalTo`, `Marshal` and `Size`
  methods.
- `Marshal` algorithm made deterministic for reliable output
  in tests.
- No generation of a `XXX_unrecognized []byte` member,
  which, while it enables a safeguard against programming
  mistakes, causes significant memory overhead.
